# KingdomFileReplacer
 A program that can automatically replace the files in a Dokapon Kingdom iso/wbfs.


How to Run
----------
Either run the Replacer.bat file or open the Source folder and run the KingdomFileReplacer.exe


How to Use
----------
Step 1: Select a copy of Dokapon Kingdom.

Step 2: Select what to replace.

Step 3: Select a folder with the necessary files.

Step 4: Apply the modification.


Notes
-----
Only ISO and WBFS files can be modified.

This program will automatically handle all file extraction and replacement.

If you select Any, this program will extract and search all the game files and replace a file if it can find it. As a result, Any is slower than the other options.

When selecting Any, files located in the GAME.PAC will not be replaced if a new GAME.PAC is provided separately.

This program assumes all file names match what is being replaced.

After pressing Apply, a new ISO file will be created in the same folder as the original game file. This will overwrite an existing file if it has the same name as the output. The new ISO can then be run through standard means.
